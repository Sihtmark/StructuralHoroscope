# **StructuralHoroscope**
## iOS & iPadOS application
### For Russian speaking users

First time user enters the date of birth and gender. Then he goes to the main screen with his card and contact list. User can add new contacts and filter them as he wants.

Structural Horoscope allows you to see what day you and your contacts have today in order to choose the right option for communication. You can also see each contact day type in the Calendar section.

The contact card displays all information about the contact and communications. There is also a section with full information of the structural horoscope.
